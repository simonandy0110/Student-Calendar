The Student Calendar is a collaborative platform for students to store their schedules and connect with other students. A student that struggles to keep an up-to-date planner could use this application to store their schedule and homework due dates. The student could view a thorough calendar with all of their deadlines. They have the ability to create events on their respective calendars that can be anything:  meetings, homework deadlines, extracurricular activities, etc. There is a to-do list feature that allows students to create a to-do list if that is how they want to manage their work. They are able to timestamp when the to-do list item was created and when the student starts working on the item. The to-do list item can also be removed from the list. Other pages and features include a login page, create account page, and a profile page.
